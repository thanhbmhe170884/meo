            <p>KinderGarden believes children are born eager and ready to learn! As educators, it is our responsibility to foster that learning by providing children with the opportunities that will allow them to create their own meanings to the world around them. We understand that it is not only important for children to develop the basic skills that will be the foundation for future learning, but they receive care from teachers who have a genuine love for children. TSP strives to provide exceptional care in a safe and nurturing environment, create an enriching learning experience for each child and seek out the most compassionate and qualified staff to care for your child.</p>
